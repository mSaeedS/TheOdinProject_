## LESSON 1 ##
-console.log() is the command to print something on console.
-Linking exteral script:
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>

Variables declaration:
1) var x = 5; are function or global scope bt not block scope
var are are declared as function begins but assigned where they're written
2) let name = "Saeed";
3) const color="255,255,255";

-Operators same as python.
-we can use 2e3 for = 2000 for =bigger numbers
-number + string = concatenation
-string + number = concatenation

let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "30";
let result = x + y + z;

The JavaScript interpreter works from left to right.
First 10 + 20 is added because x and y are both numbers.
Then 30 + "30" is concatenated because z is a string.

-When using "10"/"2" or "10"/2 JS will convert strings into numbers
and perform maths arithmatic. But it wont work with + because its
concatenation operator.
-JS has Infinity and -Infinity. xdd
- typeof and toString
- == return true to '10'==10 but === does not as === is strict.
- tofixed() to  round up decimals
- Number() to convert string into numbers.
